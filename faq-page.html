	<h1> Who can use this program? </h1>
		<p> This program is designed to help Syrian refugees living in the United States get into college to pursue higher education. Though the targeted age group is high school seniors, younger students can also use the mentorship program. </p>

	<h1> What do the mentors do? </h1>
		<p> Mentors will primarily help with the college application process (including the essay, financial aid options, choosing a college), but mentees are free to ask them other questions as well. Mentors can help students adjust to living in the United States and can also share advice and their experiences, in order to give the student the best possible help. </p>

	<h1> How does the mentorship work? </h1>
		<p> Mentor and mentee can connect through our chat boxes, which are private but also monitored.  Disrespectful or inappropriate language will result in dismissal from the program.</p>

	<h1> What can I do if I'm not a mentor or a mentee? </h1>
		<p>Lots! There are always ways to help our cause, even if you aren't directly involved in it. One important facet of our program involves decreasing the stigma that refugees are dangerous, or unimportant. They have voices, and our job is to let them be heard. By sharing their stories on social media, you can help us spread our message that refugees are welcome! Additionally, if you'd really like to leave a positive impact, help sponsor UNHCR (the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), which is the organization responsible for maintaining the crowded refugee camps in areas surrounding Syria.
