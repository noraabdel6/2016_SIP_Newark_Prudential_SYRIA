		<p>Our founding team, comprised of three female high school students, met in the summer of 2016, during a Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. Towards the end of this program, they collaborated together for a final project, combining coding skills with a common interest in helping refugees assimilate into the U.S. educational system.</p>
